Prerequisites
-------------

Xmark requires [Homebrew][b] and [Google Chrome][c].

Installation
------------

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'junegunn/vim-xmark', { 'do': 'make' }
```

Usage
-----

`:Xmark` command is added for Markdown files. After running the command, the
rendered content will be reloaded on the browser every time you save the file.

```vim
" Does not resize nor move the windows
:Xmark

" Vim on the left, browser on the right
:Xmark>

" On the left
:Xmark<

" On the top
:Xmark+

" On the bottom
:Xmark-

" Reload the page and resize the windows by saving it
:w

" Turn off Xmark
:Xmark!
```

If you see an error (e.g. `osascript is not allowed assistive access`), make
sure that your terminal emulator is in the list in `System Preferences` ->
`Security & Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility`. (You can drag and drop
the application icon to the list.)

Known issues
------------

- Resizing does not work if the terminal emulator is in fullscreen mode
